# (Mis)Measuring Competitiveness: The Quantification of a Malleable Concept in the European Semester

[Claudius Gr√§bner-Radkowitsch](https://claudius-graebner.com/) and [Theresa Hager](https://www.jku.at/institut-fuer-die-gesamtanalyse-der-wirtschaft/ueber-uns/team/theresa-hager/)



Here we provide all the data and the code to replicate all empirical exercises in the abovementioned paper. The working paper can be accessed via the [SPACE project homepage](https://spatial-competition.com/working-paper-series/)

The repository contains all code and data to replicate all figures and tables in the paper and the appendix, except the results regarding the country-specific recommendations and policy area shares in Section 4 of the Appendix, since the data is confidential. The data used in the repo is altered so as to not violate confidentiality. Thus, the script `R/CSR_database_policy_area.R` does not run properly, since the underlying data is not
present in the repo. 

Use this repo to contact us regarding any queries. Alternatively, you may [contact Theresa directly](mailto:theresa.hager@jku.at).

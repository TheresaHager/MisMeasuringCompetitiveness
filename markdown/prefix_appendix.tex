\small
This appendix complements the main paper by providing additional information
on the European Semester and alternative ways to illustrate some of the main
findings. Section \ref{sec:rules} contains a detailed description of the 
content and the time line of the Semester.
Section \ref{sec:descriptives} provides information about how Member States 
were classified according to the MIP and SGP criteria.
Then, Section \ref{sec:pics} reproduces Figure 3 of the main paper for the
SGP and MIP categories discussed before, as well as for individual Member States.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:is} summarizes information about the 
country-specific recommendations, most importantly the policy areas covered and 
assessment of the degree to which the recommendations were implemented by the
Member States.
